# Situation Dataset: freeCodeCamp data

This is a chat dataset based on the [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/freecodecamp/all-posts-public-main-chatroom][freeCodeCamp dataset], containing 250 subsets of messages I have called "situations". A situation is a subset of messages that revolves around a single event both temporally and thematically. There are six topic labels, and the subsets are of varying length and can have gaps relative to the original dataset.

The data has been manually annotated with my own software (CCA), in order to both show the functionality of the annotator and be used further in research on topic segmentation and chat untangling.
